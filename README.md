# General Approach
1. Create a grid of 7x7 cells to represent the parking lot, plane and the fuel trucks.
2. Initialize the grid with all planes, and cells set to EMPTY, meaning no fuel truck is placed yet.
3. For each aircraft, find all the adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically) and mark them as AVAILABLE for fuel trucks.
4. For each row and column, count the number of aircraft that need to be refueled and set the corresponding number outside the grid.
5. For each row and column, find all the possible combinations of fuel truck locations that satisfy the total number of fuel trucks required.
6. Use a backtracking algorithm to try all possible combinations of fuel truck locations for each row and column, while making sure that no two fuel trucks touch each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
7. If a combination of fuel truck locations satisfies all the constraints, mark the corresponding cells in the grid as 1, meaning a fuel truck is placed there.
8. If a solution is found, return the grid with the fuel truck locations. If no solution is found, return an error message.
